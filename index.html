The project that I will be focusing my efforts on for the duration of 
the semester is a personal website to act as my online business card. 
This will contain links such as my resume, my general contact info, and 
my professional account page. This will enable concise business contact 
with potential employers and professional networking opportunities. 

This may also expand to feature some of my work during the school year, 
to show off my talent sets to potential employers.
