Project Description
</Header>
<Body>
The project that I will be focusing my efforts on for the duration of 
the semester is a personal website to act as my online business card. 
This will contain links such as my resume, my general contact info, and 
my professional account page. This will enable concise business contact 
with potential employers and professional networking opportunities.

This may also expand to feature some of my work during the school year, 
to show off my talent sets to potential employers.

End Users and Goals
</Header>
<Body>
The primary user for my site should be potential employers, and people seeking information about my work history and skill set. 
My main goals for the site are the concise delivery of references and information in an easily digestible format with no clutter and clear purpose to each link and object on the page.
