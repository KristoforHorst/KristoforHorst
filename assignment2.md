Netflix - Has a good selection of big name shows, movies, and other content across a number of publicly broadcast TV channels.
Use of thumbnails for each show's movie posters or other advertisement allows users to quickly associate and identify what the show is.

Youtube - Good variety of content on this site, but not all good quality or from a "respectable" sources. Trade amount of content for quality.

HBOGo - Has a smaller variety, but all very popular shows from HBO channel. All movie quality content and good layout
